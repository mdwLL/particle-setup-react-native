# Particle Setup - React Navtive

An exploratory project for creating basic [Particle](https://www.particle.io) setup applications with react native.

## More Info:

This project is in its very early phases. I'm planning on using the [Particle Cloud API](https://docs.particle.io/reference/device-cloud/api/) to pull data for most of the particle functions, rather than trying to use the Particle JS SDK. Other community members have reported difficulties integrating the out of the box SDK with React Native, so I wanted to see if this would be a more valid approach. I figured that we'd be able to get all the info we need to make a working app with just the Cloud API.

This app will be built first with the assumption that people will use it for building products, rather than just claiming individual devices to their developer account.
